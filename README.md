# FundraiserProgram
Java2 team

This was my team assignment for JAVA PROGRAMMING II.

Here were the requirements for the assignment:

Create a GUI-based program to accept name of donor, name of charity, and amount of pledge from the user.

Display a list of entries in a JTextArea or JTable.

Modify the program you created in Week Three to write the data—name, amount, and charity—into a sequential data file.

Implement a capability of reading what is in the existing data file and displaying it in the text area.

Write a program to create a database from the data in the sequential file you created in Week Four.

Modify the GUI to connect to this database and add entries to it and read entries from it. 
Entries read from the database should be displayed in the JTextArea or JTable.

Test and debug this final program.
